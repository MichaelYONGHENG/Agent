# Agent

## üåü Introduction

This project explores the implementation of various agents leveraging models such as **OS-Atlas-Base-7B**, **OS-Atlas-Pro-7B**, **qwenvl**, and **gpt4o**. The aim is to validate agent implementation methods and develop a GUI-based agent system. Models are accessed via the OpenAI API or deployed locally using **vllm**.

### Deployment Configuration

- For open-source models:
  - Deploy using **vllm**.
  - After deployment, update the configuration file:
    ```bash
    mv grounding_model_demo/config.yaml.bak grounding_model_demo/config.yaml
    ```
  - Modify `api_key` and `model_name` in the configuration file to integrate your custom models.

## ‚úÖ TODO List

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Grounding Web Demo *(Done)*

- Successfully implemented a basic grounding web demo.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task Planning Performance Evaluation

- Test **OS-Atlas-Pro-7B** for task planning efficiency and robustness.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent System Testing

- Build a **Plan-Perceive-Reflect Agent System** using the following models:
  - **Planner**: OS-Atlas-Base-7B
  - **Perception**: OS-Atlas-Pro-7B
  - **Reflection**: qwenvl
- Conduct performance and interaction tests.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Machine Browser Demo

- Develop a demo enabling a virtual machine to be directly accessed via the browser interface.
  - Similar to **Claude's computer-use demo**.


## üõ† How to Run
